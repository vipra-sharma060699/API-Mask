          <p>The brain tumors, are the most common and aggressive disease, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of patients. Generally, various image techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound image are used to evaluate the tumor in a brain, lung, liver, breast, prostate…etc. Especially, in this work MRI images are used to diagnose tumor in the brain. However the huge amount of data generated by MRI scan thwarts manual classification of tumor vs non-tumor in a particular time. But it having some limitation (i.e) accurate quantitative measurements is provided for limited number of images. Hence trusted and automatic classification scheme are essential to prevent the death rate of human. The automatic brain tumor classification is very challenging task in large spatial and structural variability of surrounding region of brain tumor. In this work, automatic brain tum		or detection is proposed by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classification. The deeper architecture design is performed by using small kernels. The weight of the neuron is given as small. Experimental results show that the CNN archives rate of 97.5% accuracy with low complexity and compared with the all other state of arts methods.

		Brain tumor is one of the vital organs in the human body, which consists of billions of cells. The abnormal group of cell is formed from the uncontrolled division of cells, which is also called as tumor. Brain tumor are divided into two types such low grade (grade1 and grade2) and high grade (grade3 and grade4) tumor. Low grade brain tumor is called as benign. Similarly, the high grade tumor is also called as malignant. Benign tumor is not cancerous tumor. Hence it doesn’t spread other parts of the brains. However the malignant tumor is a cancerous tumor. So it spreads rapidly with indefinite boundaries to other region of the body easily. It leads to immediate death.12

		Brain MRI image is mainly used to detect the tumor and tumor progress modeling process. This information is mainly used for tumor detection and treatment processes.MRI image gives more information about givenmedical image than the CT or ultrasound image. MRI image provides detailed information about brain structureand anomaly detection in brain tissue.Actually, Scholars offered unlike automated methods for brain tumors finding and typecataloging using brain MRI images from the time when it became possible to scan and freight medical imagesto the computer. Conversely, Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are theusually used methods for their good enactment over the most recent few years.11 However freshly, Deep Learning (DL) models fixed a stirring trend in machine learning as the subterranean architecturecan efficiently represent complex relationships without needing a large number of nodes likein the superficial architectures e.g. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)and Support Vector Machine (SVM).Co		nsequently, theygrew quickly to become the state of the art in unlike health informatics areas for examplemedical image analysis, medical informatics andbioinformatics.
